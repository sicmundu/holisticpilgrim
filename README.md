# Holistic Pilgrim

## Concept.

The world [NEAR Holistic](https://twitter.com/NEARHolystic) in [NEAR Lands](https://twitter.com/NearLands) with its own history (Middle Ages, but the world is not quite our world). The history of the world will develop depending on the actions of the players. As planned, the world will also change its appearance from the events / decisions of the players. Displaying history on the Holistic Pilgrim website.

And also at any time players can spend time in this world - listen to music in the park, hold meetings, visit the NFT gallery etc.

Main events: 
1. Puzzles/puzzles; 
2. Random events;

## Puzzle.

Puzzles/puzzles will be rewarded. Rewards: NEAR, internal token (?). Some puzzles can be made in such a way that players interact with NEAR ecosystem projects (for example: throw Ref Finance into the liquidity pool; interaction with the Croncat contract created for the puzzle).

An example of a simple puzzle: 

1. Interaction with the title plate on the map;
2. Link to the text of the puzzle after the interaction;
3. Solving the puzzle by the player: 
3.1. Mint NFT via a unique link; 
3.2. Sending NFT to a specific wallet (as a confirmation of the decision);
5. The results of the puzzle.

### Atocha Protocol

I have already contacted Atocha Protocol and my idea of ​​a collaboration could be to do some puzzles directly through Atocha. (Check with Vlad)

 

## History of the world.

After each solution of the puzzle, the results will be summed up and depending on the result (the percentage of players who solved the puzzle / not solved the puzzle / only one solved the puzzle), the history of the world will change. The history of the world in milestone will be recorded on the blockchain. Major events will be displayed on the Holistic Pilgrim website.

First puzzles/puzzles: 
1. Collect items on the map;
2. Simple puzzles (they won't be directly in NEAR Lands)


## Entertainment.

- Fishing;
- Daily quests (collecting items)



## Additionally, ideas.
- "Diary" of players - any player will be able to make an entry in the blockchain in the form of a diary (most likely with pre-moderation)



## What is all this for?
One of the initial goals is to build hype around the NEAR ecosystem and increase interest in the Metaverse and p2e on NEAR.
